   ## 1.Introduction
OpenCart is free open source e-commerce platform for online merchants. OpenCart provides a professional and reliable foundation from which to build a successful online store.Ranging from seasoned web developers looking for a user-friendly interface to use, to shop owners just launching their business online for the first time. OpenCart has an extensive amount of features that gives you a strong hold over the customization of your store.This release will have limited features and stocks.
   ### 1.1 Project objective
  OpenCart's administration side of the store is where you can modify features, upload images, add products, keep track of customers, manage payments, and much more. Customization in the admin affects how the customer will interact with a store: by modifying the look, structure, and content of the store front.
