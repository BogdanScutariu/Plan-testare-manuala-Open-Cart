  This guide serves as a resource to users needing direction in navigating the OpenCart interface. We detail the aspects involved with setting up your store: complete with keeping it up to date to the latest version, meeting the technical requirements, accessing the admin panel, and uninstallation. The User Guide covers the essentials tools used for managing your store front through the administration side. We will walk you through the important sections of the administration interface: Catalog, Extensions, Sales, Systems, and Reports. In this area we will cover which part of your store front each section is responsible for, and how you can modify them in the administration side to meet your storeâ€™s needs. Important store procedures, such as adding products to your store, keeping track of sales, managing customers, changing layouts, adding extensions, and more is explained in this guide.
